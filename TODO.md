<u>_Long-term_</u>
---------

- Character attributes are leveled based on activity. If a character uses strength a lot, then the character will level his strength.

- Multiple areas for attacking: head, chest, arms, legs? The damage done will be greater based on the chance of hitting: chest -> legs -> arms -> head. 

### Optimizations

- Shaders are expensive to change. Sort rendering so that the least amount of shaders/programs are changed.
