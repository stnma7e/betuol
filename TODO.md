<u>_Story_</u>
-------------

- Character attributes are leveled based on activity. If a character uses strength a lot, then the character will level his strength.

- Multiple areas for attacking: head, chest, arms, legs? The damage done will be greater based on the chance of hitting: chest -> legs -> arms -> head.

- You can tell the attributes of a player by size/external features.

- Players are in one of two factions: upper class, lower class (name later). Upper class lives in acropolis and has money/looks nice. Lower class lives outside city (in the village/slums). Each has it's own community and players.

- Collecting taxes from players. Tax collector comes around every so often and asks for taxes. If you don't pay, then the AI city officials will hunt you down.

- Patron-client system.

- Metallurgy: players make their own weapons/tools. Can mine ore and smelt it/make alloys and mix molten metals to make stronger ones.
   - Metals have attributes that are combined in certain ways when mixed.

- Open PVP: Players can attack anyone if the attacker is a lower level than what he is attacking. If not AI city guards etc. come attack the higher level guy.

- Guilds/clubs for classes.

- Three (or more) warring factions. When in a state of peace, trade is allowed and players can interact, when in a state of war, player can interact but only "underground", in secret, away from the NPCs of the factions. 1984-esque
