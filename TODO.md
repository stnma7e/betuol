<u>_Short-term_</u>
----------

- Character system
	- Type of interaction:
		- Attack
		- Run: removes interaction after certain distance.
	- Combat system:
		- Set up a targeted combat system: WoW-like. You must select a target to attack/interact with. Should be changed to more like Neverwinter: all abilities can be used at any time, but they may not be near anything. This change will happen whenever possible.
		- Combat is not turn based. Attacks take a certain amount of time, and blocks are instantaneous. There are visual cues to show when the player should block <s>and counterattacks can be used to have more damage</s>.


- Fix 4x4 matrix inverse

<u>_Long-term_</u>
---------

- Add to documentation. The docs are pretty much bare bones, so they need to be improved.

- Add unit tests.

- Collision/physics system.

- WRITE STORY!!!

<u>_Gameplay_</u>
-------------

- Character attributes are leveled based on activity. If a character uses strength a lot, then the character will level his strength.

- Multiple areas for attacking: head, chest, arms, legs? The damage done will be greater based on the chance of hitting: chest -> legs -> arms -> head.

- You can tell the attributes of a player by size/external features.

- Players are in one of two factions: upper class, lower class (name later). Upper class lives in acropolis and has money/looks nice. Lower class lives outside city (in the village/slums). Each has it's own community and players.

- Collecting taxes from players. Tax collector comes around every so often and asks for taxes. If you don't pay, then the AI city officials will hunt you down.

- Patron-client system.

- Metallurgy: players make their own weapons/tools. Can mine ore and smelt it/make alloys and mix molten metals to make stronger ones.
   - Metals have attributes that are combined in certain ways when mixed.

- Open PVP: Players can attack anyone if the attacker is a lower level than what he is attacking. If not AI city guards etc. come attack the higher level guy.

- Guilds/clubs for classes.

- Three (or more) warring factions. When in a state of peace, trade is allowed and players can interact, when in a state of war, player can interact but only "underground", in secret, away from the NPCs of the factions. 1984-esque

- Abilities are aquired through quests and loots. Spells can be learned from scroll drops/rewards.
